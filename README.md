MicroCost is a production-ready CLI tool that maps microservices architecture and calculates the true cost of each API endpoint by tracing dependencies across service boundaries. The tool combines static code analysis, runtime metrics from Prometheus, and cloud billing data to provide comprehensive cost insights.
